# Particle Swarm Optimization
This is a repository for my first Particle Swarm Optimizer.
It supposed to be implemented based on the 1995 paper:
Eberhart, R. and Kennedy, J. (1995). A new optimizer using particle swarm theory. MHS’95. Proceedings of the Sixth International Symposium on Micro Machine and Human Science [4–6 Oct. 1995].
